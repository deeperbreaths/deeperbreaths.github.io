    <h1 id="airway-clearance-therapy">Airway Clearance Therapy</h1>
<p>We hope this page would be a resource for parents to understand the different types of machines available. We were only told of one device when we initially got our diagnoses, so as the years have progressed we have learned about other machines, other treatment options, travel-friendly options, and have wanted to explore deeper so we could choose the best for our family. Hopefully this page can be an easy-to-understand resource for you, so you can be fully informed before getting locked into one device and company. We are not intending to give any sort of medical advice! Please take the information you learn here and go prepared to your pulmonologist to discuss the effectiveness of the therapies, and be able to ask them questions about why they recommend one version over another. We wish we had known about other options before we purchased our machines. They are expensive!</p>
<p>Things to note before deciding on a specific machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer service.</li>
<li>Product size.</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning.</li>
<li>Customer reviews.</li>
<li>Kid-friendly usage.</li>
<li>Ease of programming different functions.</li>
<li>How easy is it to customize the size of the vest.</li>
<li>Effectiveness.</li>
<li>Do we recommend or not? &ndash; We are working on updating with devices we have tried, how they clean, whether it is easy to sterilize, how effective they seem to be, if they work for younger kids or not, how likely we would recommend, what research shows as far as clearance, situations where we believe it would be useful to use, ages able to effectively use, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aerobic-activity">Aerobic Activity</h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when you do a lot of running, deep breathing, or other breath-intensive exercise, you trigger coughs? Getting air into all the small passageways of the lungs is so important for maintaining lung function. Please find a way to move and be active every day! Kids learn best from example (it’s definitely a case of, “do as I do, even if I say to do otherwise.”), so finding a family workout that you can do together is incredibly helpful. Take a walk! Go for a walk/jog/run! Encourage movement always, even gentle movement during illness. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5if4cjO5nxo">Here is an easy family workout on Youtube!</a></p>
<h3 id="hfcwo----high-frequency-chest-wall-oscillation">HFCWO &ndash; High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation</h3>
<p>This is the most common day-to-day device used for airway clearance therapy. An inflatable vest uses air pressure to vibrate the chest/lung wall, increasing airflow to smaller passages and aiding in mucus clearance. It usually cycles 5 min of treatment, a break for coughs, then another treatment cycle. We use this method for everyday treatments, and they last about 35 minutes (with a prep period and a put away period. We plan for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the excitement level of the distraction used during the treatment). There are a few different versions available. We have personally used the Hillrom Vest and the Respirtech Vest. We use this in conjunction with a nebulized solution to break up mucus, with the theory being that you thin and break up mucus, shake it off of the lung walls, and then cough it out. I am looking for different brands to research: Vest airway Clearance System, Medpulse Respiratory Vest System, others? We plan to review as many as we can get our hands on, and post the pros and cons of each system here for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="www.afflovest.com">www.afflovest.com</a> &ndash; This is one I would love to try, as it says it is fully portable (battery powered! No cords, no tubes, easy for travel!) and able to be used from an 18-inch chest circumference on up. The only other portable option I have found so far is the Hillrom Monarch, which is FDA approved for ages 15+.</li>
<li><a href="www.smartvest.com">www.smartvest.com</a> &ndash; No info on this one yet.</li>
<li><a href="www.hillrom.com">www.hillrom.com</a> &ndash; We have two of these. The customer service is excellent! We did have one of the machines stop working and they had a new one to our home the very next day. The tubes are very annoying, as they are some plastic material that tends to be brittle and the connection into the machine tends to snap if a child drops it on the floor while putting it in or putting it away. It also does not have a &ldquo;lock&rdquo; of any sort for the connection to the vest itself, so the tubes are held in place by only friction. This has led to much frustration when tubes pop out during treatments, both from the machine after the twist connection there gets broken, and from the vest when the friction hold gets weak. The travel case is well made, though very large. The machine itself can be traveled with in a carry-on suitcase along with the medication and a nebulizer machine for a much more convenient travel experience, though the case that comes with it is very nice and durable. It has been easy to program and except for the one failed machine, it has always worked very well and very effectively. It is heavy! But in general, it has been a good device overall. The vest is difficult to adjust the fit as the straps are very stiff, but you won't need to worry about that loosening during treatments.</li>
<li><a href="respirtech.com">www.respirtech.com</a>  &ndash; We have one of these that we are trying. I do tend to prefer this one, not in terms of effectiveness but in terms of ease-of-use. The Hillrom feels like it was made with a sturdier case, as the travel case for this one has pretty crummy wheels. I have not tried to fit it into a carry-on suitcase, but I think it would fit with all the other therapy components in one suitcase, so the travel case might not need to be a deal-breaker. The connections for the tubes onto the device are simple, but I appreciate that they lock into place. The connection is the same for connecting to the vest itself, so it's very easy for kids to use as well. I like the one button approach towards starting the treatment cycle, but I cannot speak to the overall effectiveness of it as compared to the HillRom system. We have not noticed any change either way, though this may be child-rated as slightly more comfortable in how it compresses. It is easy to use, seems to work effectively for us, and I tend to prefer this one over the HillRom because of the hoses and the one-touch button start. We have not dealt with customer service at all, so I cannot comment there.</li>

<h3 id="flutter-mucus-clearance-system">Flutter Mucus Clearance System</h3>
<p>This treatment combines PEP therapy (see below) with high frequency oscillation, a controlled vibration system that gently oscillates the large and small airways in the lungs. It creates vibrations upon exhale, helping loosen mucus from bronchial walls while accelerating airflow to stimulate mucus clearance. A cough is usually stimulated after several exhales. Picture exhaling through loose lips and making them flutter, except instead of an external flutter, the vibrations tranfer to the air passages. Since this is a gentle treatment, it won’t work if the airways are extremely obstructed. Some brands are Acapella, Cornet, and Aerobika OPEP. The Aerobika was recommended to us by our respiratory therapist as being the easiest to clean; however, we have yet to try it.</p>
<h1 id="pep---positive-epiratory-pressure">PEP - Positive Epiratory Pressure</h1>
<p>These treatments uses a facemask or mouthpiece while inhaling and exhaling as normal. A mechanical action inside the device creates resistance so air is forced to enter the small airways in your lungs, creating pressure that gently dislodges sputum. This gets pushed towards the larger airways making it easier to cough up. Some brands are Astra PEP, Pari PEP, and AeroPEP. We have not used this at all, and it has yet to come up in our pulmonogy visits as an option. I first read about it on <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/copd-airway-clearance-devices-914996">www.verywellhealth.com</a> and I will look into it more and ask about it at my next pulmonology visit.</p>
<h1 id="ipv---intrapulmonary-percussive-ventilation">IPV - Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation</h1>
<p>Here is another new-to-me therapy: it delivers small bursts of air through a mouthpiece into lungs, vibrates chest, loosens mucus deep in airways. Learn more at <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/copd-airway-clearance-devices-914996">www.verywellhealth.com</a></p>
<h1 id="ohfo---oral-high-frequency-oscillation">OHFO - Oral High Frequency Oscillation</h1>
<p>Another new one: low volume, high frequency jet oscillation to lungs through a mouthpiece. This treatment uses sound frequency, which helps clear carbon dioxide and sputum. Ask your pulmonogist and respiratory therapist for more information on the effectiveness of these types of things. I cannot see them being a replacement for the HFCWO treatments, but maybe your doctor would recommend them as a supplement. Have you used any of these devices? <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/copd-airway-clearance-devices-914996">https://www.verywellhealth.com</a></p>
<h1 id="lung-flute-acoustic-induction-device--">Lung Flute Acoustic Induction Device -</h1>
<p>This is a handheld device that generates low-frequency sound waves in the airways as you vigorously exhale through a reeded mouthpiece. This is similar to a reed instrument. The theory is that the sound waves travel down into the lower airways and stimulate mucus clearance. Have you used this? Does it work for you? How is this different from playing bass clarinet? Here is a write-up from <a href="https://lungdiseasenews.com/2014/09/30/study-finds-copd-patients-breathe-easier-lung-flute-device/">www.lungdiseasenews.com</a> that discusses its use in COPD.</p>
<p>All of these devices are generally used with a nebulized solution to dilate the airways and/or thin mucus. Other things they are used in conjunction with are the Huff cough technique, controlled coughing, chest percussion, or postural drainage, or a combination of many. Work with your doctor to find what works for you and your lifestyle! The most important thing is to stay healthy!</p>
