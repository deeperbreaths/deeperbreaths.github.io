      <description>What is my doctor asking and why? Have you ever felt like you go into an appointment and get interrogated? The doctor asks:
 How often do you do this? How long do you do that? What sort of things do you notice when you do this? How does that make you feel? When did you notice these symptoms? How long have they persisted?  We hope to help you understand why the doctor asks the questions he or she asks, and how to feel confident you are giving them accurate information.</description>
