<h3 id="why-am-i-getting-so-many-bills">Why am I getting so many bills?</h3>
<p>One of the more frustrating things you run into in the medical world is that foggy world of medical billing. You go to the clinic, do a bunch of things, and then a month (or for us, even up to six months) later, you get not just one bill, but many. Here are a few things that will clear up why you get multiple bills:</p>
<p>Many times, a clinic or hospital is an entity that does not employ the doctors itself, but it hires a “group” of doctors. There are exceptions, when you get one bill that covers the doctor visit, the clinic’s using-up-some-space-and-supplies charge, and a few charges for different procedures. Often, though, there are a few bills, and it is because the clinic bills for the space/time/supplies/tests, and the doctor bills for their time. This is especially common for situations involving anesthesia, x-rays, or outside practitioners coming in during hospital stays.</p>
<h3 id="tests-may-be-performed-by-an-independent-lab">Tests may be performed by an independent lab</h3>
<p>Sometimes tests are sent out to an independent lab for reading. The sample is collected in-clinic, and then sent out to a different place for reading or interpreting. In this case, you get the clinic bill, and the bill from the place that actually finalized the testing.
If there are multiple procedures performed (especially common during in-patient care), there will be a bill from the hospital or in-patient clinic for the stay. There will also be a bill from any doctors’ groups that rounded on you, and for surgical procedures, another bill from the anesthesia group. If there were x-rays taken, you might get a bill from the radiology group.</p>
<p>Basically, view a hospital as a collection of professionals that work together to care for you, but independently charge for their time. If you are lucky, there will be less bills rather than more.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-bill-not-adding-up">Why is my bill not adding up?</h3>
<p>This was a very difficult thing to grasp for us. Many, many times we would get a bill that showed the initial charge. Then, there would be notated an amount that insurance had paid. A third line showed what the patient owed. And more often than not, the insurance+patient owed amount did not equal the amount of the initial charge!</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill shows charge of $250 for procedure x on date y.</li>
<li>Insurance paid $150 on date z. Patient may owe $50.</li>
<li>Final amount due from patient: $45.97.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this magical amount shift is the fact that insurance companies contractually agree on a price with hospitals and clinics for services provided. They negotiate together for an amount that the insurance is willing to pay for a procedure. Knowing that the insurance will always negotiate down, hospitals often increase their pricing such that the negotiated drop in price aligns with what they actually expect to receive for the services provided. Our bills typically did not itemize the pricing difference between what the hospital charged vs what the insurance company paid. We were often confused by this discrepency, as we had expected to be charged the difference. This is not the case - we were responsible for the insurance adjusted amount. Billing has gotten better at this, but there are still discrepancies. We now see an “adjusted price” on some of our bills when there is an amount difference between billed amount, insurance payment, and amount we owe. After calling insurance to clarify bills received, it was explained to us that the missing payment amount is written off as a deduction on taxes.</p>
<p>This has been incredibly frustrating for us to navigate, because we have dealt with multiple times where we have been overcharged by hospital and clinic billing offices. I don’t know how many times it has happened, but I want to estimate the amount is around $1000 total that we have been misbilled over the years. To me, that is not an acceptable burden to put on a “consumer.”</p>
<p>Hopefully this information has been helpful, and hopefully no one else deals with frustrating billing issues!</p>
