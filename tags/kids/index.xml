      <description>From our kids to your kids It&#39;s hard to sit still for the treatment time. Favorite things to do during vests: Prodigy math game, little legos &amp;ndash; especially new sets, Art for kids hub on youtube, Em Winn on Amazon Prime Video, Curiosity Streams, playing with siblings with toys, parents reading books (Who is/What was series is educational and great for kids 2nd - 6th or beyond), coloring books, color by number.</description>
