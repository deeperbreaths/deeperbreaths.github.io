      <description>What is my doctor asking and why? Have you ever felt like you go into an appointment and get interrogated? The doctor asks:
 How often do you do this? How long do you do that? What sort of things do you notice when you do this? How does that make you feel? When did you notice these symptoms? How long have they persisted?  We hope to help you understand why the doctor asks the questions he or she asks, and how to feel confident you are giving them accurate information.</description>

      <description>Understanding Billing &amp;ndash; USA specific Why am I getting so many bills?

You go to the clinic, do a bunch of things, and then a month (or for us, even up to six months) later, you get not just one bill, but many. Here are a few things that will clear up why you get multiple bills:</description>

      <description>Understanding Insurance &amp;ndash; USA specific Choosing A Plan Which insurance plan should you choose? Which insurance plan is best? What are the differences between insurance plans? There are a few typical health insurance plans offered through employers. Some employers only offer one type, some offer multiple, and sometimes you have to shop for your own plan. When they throw in all of the acronyms they love to use, it can be easy to get confused!</description>

      <description>Setting up for success Tip #1: Keep activities fresh. Have something that only gets done during treatments, and rotate a few things often.
 Check out our From our kids to your kids page for ideas that would work for you!  Tip #2: Organize the chaos. Get a good organization system, in a convenient location.
  I hope to add a few cabinets that would work to fit the vests without modifications.</description>

      <description>From our kids to your kids Kids like variety! We like to do a few different things during our vest treatments to keep us occupied, and we like to switch things up so that it stays fun and doesnâ€™t feel like a chore! We broke the activities up into categories, and our mom and dad will include links to buy them if those are available.
Sensory:   Homemade slime! We love to make slime and then play with it.</description>

      <description>Airway Clearance Therapy We hope this page would be a resource for parents to understand the different types of machines available. We were only told of one device when we initially got our diagnoses, so as the years have progressed we have learned about other machines, other treatment options, travel-friendly options, and have wanted to explore deeper so we could choose the best for our family. Hopefully this page can be an easy-to-understand resource for you, so you can be fully informed before getting locked into one device and company.</description>
