                <h1 id="what-is-primary-ciliary-dyskinesia">What is primary ciliary dyskinesia?</h1>
<p>Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is an inherited disorder that affects cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures in various places in the body, including the airways, sinuses, and ear canals. The structures form incorrectly, causing difficulties in clearing mucus. There may also be differences in the organ placement in the abdomen, with some or all organs reversed. Some have heart defects, and some have no spleen or multiple spleens. Though all the genes causing this disorder are not yet known, research is being done to isolate which genes have the mutations that cause PCD. <a href="www.pcdfoundation.org/faq/">Visit the FAQ page of the PCD Foundation</a> for much more in-depth information.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-cystic-fibrosis">What is Cystic Fibrosis?</h1>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and the pancreas, and other organs. While it is estimated that the same amount of people have CF and PCD, CF is much more well-known, and comes from a single gene mutation so it is more easily diagnosable. Aggressive proactive treatment is required to keep individuals healthy, and along with PCD, avoiding illness is a huge factor in keeping individuals with CF healthier. We are far more familiar with PCD since we live with it every day, so <a href="https://www.cff.org/What-is-CF/About-Cystic-Fibrosis/">visit the experts over at the CF Foundation</a> to learn more.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-copd">What is COPD?</h1>
<p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder. The name is pretty clear in explaining what the disease is like: it is chronic, so long-lasting; it is an obstructive pulmonary disorder, which means airflow is restricted to the lungs. This is not a genetic disorder, but rather something that develops over time. Many environmental factors (as opposed to an inherited disorder) can contribute to the relative health or lack of for an individual with COPD, but we included it here since it is also another chronic disorder that may use airway clearance technologies.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-airway-clearance-therapies">What are airway clearance therapies?</h1>
<p>Airway clearance therapies are treatments used to help our bodies out when they are having difficulty clearing mucus from the airways. There are a couple different methods and devices used, but in general people sit for a treatment wearing a vest that compresses and vibrates mucus from the smaller alveoli in the lungs, so it can be coughed out. Typically done in conjunction with nebulized medicine, the theory is that aggressive proactive treatment will prevent lung infections and lung damage, leading to a longer and higher quality of life. This is the best medical practice at the moment based on current research and therapies.</p>
