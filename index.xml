      <description>Setting up for success Tip #1: Keep activities fresh. Have something that only gets done during treatments, and rotate a few things often.
 Check out our From our kids to your kids page for ideas that would work for you!  Tip #2: Organize the chaos. Get a good organization system, in a convenient location.
 I hope to add a few cabinets that would work to fit the vests without modifications.</description>

      <description>What is primary ciliary dyskinesia? Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is an inherited disorder that affects cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures in various places in the body, including the airways, sinuses, and ear canals. The structures form incorrectly, causing difficulties in clearing mucus. There may also be differences in the organ placement in the abdomen, with some or all organs reversed. Some have heart defects, and some have no spleen or multiple spleens.</description>

      <description>From our kids to your kids Kids like variety! We like to do a few different things during our vest treatments to keep us occupied, and we like to switch things up so that it stays fun and doesnâ€™t feel like a chore! We broke the activities up into categories, and our mom and dad will include links to buy them if those are available.
Sensory:   Homemade slime! We love to make slime and then play with it.</description>

 #airwayclearancetherapy #primaryciliarydyskinesia #pcd #cysticfibrosis  Cystic Fibrosis has far more resources surrounding aiway clearance and hospitalization support, as it is more well-known, researched, and public. Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is still in the newer stages of diagnosis and research, but every moment that passes, more learning is happening!</description>

      <description>About Us Hello! We are Karen and Steve, parents of soon-to-be six kids, two of whom are diagnosed with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. We will see about the sixth after he is born! We have been navigating the space and lifestyle of airway clearance treatments for almost six years now, and thought that we could share some things we have learned along the way. Stop in, explore, and learn how to live a full life by taking deeper breaths!</description>

      <description>Airway Clearance Therapy We hope this page would be a resource for parents to understand the different types of machines available. We were only told of one device when we initially got our diagnoses, so as the years have progressed we have learned about other machines, other treatment options, travel-friendly options, and have wanted to explore deeper so we could choose the best for our family. Hopefully this page can be an easy-to-understand resource for you, so you can be fully informed before getting locked into one device and company.</description>
