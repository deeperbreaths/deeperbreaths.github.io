    <h1 id="understanding-insurance----usa-specific">Understanding Insurance &ndash; USA specific</h1>
<h3 id="choosing-a-plan">Choosing A Plan</h3>
<p>Which insurance plan should you choose? Which insurance plan is best? What are the differences between insurance plans? There are a few typical health insurance plans offered through employers. Some employers only offer one type, some offer multiple, and sometimes you have to shop for your own plan. When they throw in all of the acronyms they love to use, it can be easy to get confused! FSA, HSA, HRA, healthcare sharing plans&hellip;let’s dive in and see what they mean.</p>
<h3 id="flex-spending-account">Flex Spending Account</h3>
<p>FSA stands for Flex Spending Account. This is money that the insurance plan “gives” you each year to spend on medical costs. It’s “flex” because you can choose to use it on approved items. These might be medical equipment, covering copays or deductibles (see down below), or buying medical supplies like contacts, glasses, band aids, pharmacy prescriptions, and those types of things. The amount you get each year depends on your specific plan. Typically, this money does not roll over to the next year, so the people who have these plans tend to race out and buy bandaids, antibiotic ointments, and revamp their first aid kit in December if they have not used up all of that money. Not surprisingly, it is not hard to use up those funds if you are dealing with a chronic illness. This plan type tends to have a higher premium and lower deductible/co-insurance/out-of-pocket max.</p>
<h3 id="health-savings-account">Health Savings Account</h3>
<p>HSA stands for Health Savings Account. This is money that is taxed, then put into an account that can be accessed specifically for paying medical costs. This plan tends to have lower premiums and higher deductible/co-insurance/out-of-pocket max. You are also able to use these funds for buying approved items, like prescriptions, medical supplies, and covering the deductible up to the out-of-pocket max. You might consider this plan if you want to “bank up” a savings account that will not be penalized by taxes when you take it out to use. You are allowed to put a certain amount in each year, and that money is invested so it will grow for you. You choose to take out as you need, or let it grow so you can have a medical emergency fund.</p>
<h3 id="health-reimbursement-arrangement">Health Reimbursement Arrangement</h3>
<p>A Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) is similar to the HSA and FSA plans, in that it can be used to cover medical expsenses. This account is an employer-funded account. The rules on these change starting January 2020, so the use cases may change as well. When we have had HRA accounts, we have also had an FSA or an HSA account that was used to cover the expenses incurred after the HRA funds had been used up. It used to be that bills were automatically deducted from our HRA until that maximum was reached, then the bills started coming to us. With the new rules regarding these accounts, there is a little more flexibility in deciding where the funds go, but check into your specific plan to see what your options are.</p>
<h3 id="health-care-sharing">Health Care Sharing</h3>
<p>Health Care Sharing plans are alternatives that are available, but pre-existing conditions are not covered. They might be useful if you would like to insure part of a family one way, and have a higher coverage for one with a chronic illness on a different insurance plan to bring medical costs down. Typically, these plans work well for generally healthy individuals, as basic coverage (wellness visits, etc) tends to get good reviews. A few examples are Samaritan Ministries, Medishare, and Liberty HealthShare.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-premiums">What are premiums?</h3>
<p>Premiums are basically your membership fee to access the services of insurance. If you want to shop at Costco, you have to buy into their membership program so you can get their discounted prices. If you want to use the insurance company services, you have to “buy in” to their policy so you can access the benefits. You can look into each policy and what it provides in their EOB: Explanation of Benefits (yes, another acronym!).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-deductible">What is a deductible?</h3>
<p>A deductible is the amount you will have to pay towards medical costs before the insurance will start covering anything. This can be $500, $2000, $5000&hellip;it really depends on your specific plan. When you see premiums cost, add the deductible to that cost to know what you will pay before the insurance will cover anything.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-co-insurance">What is co-insurance?</h3>
<p>Co-insurance is when the insurance policy covers part of the medical costs, and you cover the rest. A common way this works is that you will pay $1000 towards a deductible, then the insurance will kick in and pay at 80% until a certain amount. You then pay 20% of the billed amount, up to an out-of-pocket max.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-out-of-pocket-maximum">What is an out-of-pocket maximum?</h3>
<p>An out-of-pocket maximum is the maximum amount you will have to pay before insurance covers 100%. If your deductible is $1000 and your out-of-pocket max is $4000, insurance will pay all of the bills between $1000 and $4000 of your cost at 80% coverage. Once there has been enough medical charges, insurance will cover 100%. So, using those numbers, you pay $4000 out of pocket for total bills of $16,000 ($1000 of deductible, 20% of $15,000 is $3000 for a total of $4000).</p>
<p>Knowing how much you typically spend on medical care each year can help you make your decision as to which plan you pick. If you get a general idea of how much each specialist costs, and figure out on average how much hospital time you have each year, adding those up to see which coverage brings you out ahead will save you a few dollars.
Still confused? Questions I didn’t answer? Did I get something wrong? Feel free to contact us and we can try to address your questions or concerns. We also don’t mind hearing your venting at all! Insurance can be so nice and can also be incredibly frustrating.</p>
