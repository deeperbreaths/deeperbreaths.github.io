      <description>Setting up for success Tip #1 Have something that only gets done during treatments, and rotate a few things often.
 Check out our From our kids to your kids page for ideas that would work for you!  Tip #2 Get a good organization system, in a convenient location.
 I hope to add a few cabinets that would work to fit the vests without modifications. If the sky is the limit or if you are handy, do a custom built-in.</description>

      <description>From our kids to your kids Kids like variety! We like to do a few different things during our vest treatments to keep us occupied, and we like to switch things up so that it stays fun and doesnâ€™t feel like a chore! We broke the activities up into categories, and our mom and dad will include links to buy them if those are available.
Sensory:   Homemade slime! We love to make slime and then play with it.</description>
