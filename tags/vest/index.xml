      <description>Airway Clearance Therapy We hope this page would be a resource for parents to understand the different types of machines available. We were only told of one device when we initially got our diagnoses, so as the years have progressed we have learned about other machines, other treatment options, travel-friendly options, and have wanted to explore deeper so we could choose the best for our family. Hopefully this page can be an easy-to-understand resource for you, so you can be fully informed before getting locked into one device and company.</description>
