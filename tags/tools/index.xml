      <description>From our kids to your kids Kids like variety! We like to do a few different things during our vest treatments to keep us occupied, and we like to switch things up so that it stays fun and doesnâ€™t feel like a chore! We broke the activities up into categories, and our mom and dad will include links to buy them if those are available.
Sensory:   Homemade slime! We love to make slime and then play with it.</description>

      <description>Setting up for success Have something that only gets done during treatments. Rotate a few things often. Get a good organization system. Make it a convenient location. Ideas for cabinets that fit vests and medication. If the sky&#39;s the limit, do a custom built-in. Make the space cozy. Good lighting. Sensory Table with understorage &amp;ndash; ikea table with orbeez or water beads in it. Something contained but fun. Little legos inside those bins with a surface to build on would be excellent.</description>
